# HTML code for the Covid-data dashboard

The use-case is for the code within the `<body>` tags to be pasted into a Google Sites instance.

The data gets sourced from [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16YiakYsj_PkZjN6PSnY-6xhUDBjEH4hWkcQQPIcxV3w) Google Sheets page.


To-do list:

* replace color code with vaccine availability, link here: https://www.amherstcovid19.org/vaccine
* put vaccine info above dashboard header
* think how to deal with missing data - leave empty or fill out from the date before?
* add up/down arrow to "delta" number
* data link should be view-only, maybe should be a csv file?
* pull when was last updated from GSheets json
* add data notes section at the end (amherst only, missing dates rolled over, last updated)
* make responsive better, test on mobile
* make graph less full-screen at its largest
